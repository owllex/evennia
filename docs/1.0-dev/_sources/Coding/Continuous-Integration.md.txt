# Continuous Integration

One of the advantages of Evennia over traditional MU* development systems is that Evennia can
integrate into enterprise-level integration environments and source control.

## What is Continuous Integration (CI)?

[Continuous Integration (CI)](https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration) is a development
practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository.
Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early. This 
can be set up to safely deploy data to a production server only after tests have passed, for example.

For Evennia, continuous integration allows an automated build process to:

* Pull down a latest build from Source Control.
* Run migrations on the backing SQL database.
* Automate additional unique tasks for that project.
* Run unit tests.
* Publish those files to the server directory
* Reload the game.

## List of continuous integration tools

There are a lot of tools and services providing CI functionality. Here are a few that people have used 
with Evennia:
