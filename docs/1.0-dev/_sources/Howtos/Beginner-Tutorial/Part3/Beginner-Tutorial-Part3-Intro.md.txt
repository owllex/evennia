In part three of the Evennia Beginner tutorial we will go through the creation of several key parts of our tutorial
game _EvAdventure_. This is a pretty big part with plenty of examples.

If you followed the previous parts of this tutorial you will have some notions about Python and where to find
and make use of things in Evennia. We also have a good idea of the type of game we want.
Even if this is not the game-style you are interested in, following along will give you a lot of experience
with using Evennia. This be of much use when doing your own thing later.
