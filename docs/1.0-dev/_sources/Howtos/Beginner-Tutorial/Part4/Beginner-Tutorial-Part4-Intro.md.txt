  `Introduction <../Beginner-Tutorial-Intro.html>`_
    Getting set up.
  Part 1: `What we have <../Part1/Beginner-Tutorial-Part1-Intro.html>`_
    A tour of Evennia and how to use the tools, including an introduction to Python.
  Part 2: `What we want <../Part2/Beginner-Tutorial-Part2-Intro.html>`_
    Planning our tutorial game and what to think about when planning your own in the future.
  Part 3: `How we get there <../Part3/Beginner-Tutorial-Part3-Intro.html>`_
       Getting down to the meat of extending Evennia to make our game to make a tech-demo
  **Part 4: Using what we created**
    Using the tech-demo and world content to go with our code
  Part 5: `Showing the world <../Part5/Beginner-Tutorial-Part5-Intro.html>`_
    Taking our new game online and let players try it out
```

We now have the code underpinnings of everything we need. We have also tested the various components
and has a simple tech-demo to show it all works together. But there is no real coherence to it at this
point - we need to actually make a world.
In part four we will expand our tech demo into a more full-fledged (if small) game by use of batchcommand
and batchcode processors.
