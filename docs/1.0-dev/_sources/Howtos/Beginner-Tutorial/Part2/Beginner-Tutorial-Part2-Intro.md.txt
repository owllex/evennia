In Part two of the Beginner Tutorial we'll take a step back and plan out the kind of tutorial
game we want to make. This is a more 'theoretical' part where we won't do any hands-on
programming. 

In the process we'll go through the common questions of "where to start"
and "what to think about" when creating a multiplayer online text game.
