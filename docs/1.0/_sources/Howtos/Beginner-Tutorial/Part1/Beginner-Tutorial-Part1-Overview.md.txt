In this first part we'll focus on what we get out of the box in Evennia - we'll get used to the tools,
and how to find things we are looking for. We will also dive into some of things you'll
need to know to fully utilize the system, including giving you a brief rundown of Python concepts. If you are
an experienced Python programmer, some sections may feel a bit basic, but you will at least not have seen
these concepts in the context of Evennia before.
